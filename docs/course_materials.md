# Course material

## Getting started

For those just beginning to use Git, GitHub, Jupyter, Python, Jupyter books, see the DOCUMENTATION section of this website.

## Course transformations

**All the course material below is under development as of October, 2020**

Some courses will have all (or most) material converted for deployment using Jupyter Books, others will include Python programming requirements, and some will have new interactive dashboards built for illustrating and exploring quantitative processes and concepts in courses taken by students in other disciplines.

* [EOSC 211](https://andrewloeppky.github.io/eosc211/title_211.html)
* [EOSC 354](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/academics/courses/eosc354). All 11 lab assignments are being converted to Python using Jupyter Notebooks.
* [ATSC 301](https://phaustin.github.io/a301_code/)
* [ATSC 409](https://clouds.eos.ubc.ca/~phil/numeric/)
* [DSCI 100](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/dsci-100): This course is taught using the "R" language by Department of Statistics, UBC. 
    * [Here](dsci100-datasets.md) is a summary of data sets used in the winter 2020 version.
    * The OCESE project's role is to generate a Python version of the course, and to provide suitable datasets that are related to climate and other Earth, ocean or atmospheric science topics.  
* EOSC 340

Other courses likely to be impacted between 2020 and 2023 include EOSC 350, EOSC 354, EOSC 410/510, EOSC420, EOSC442, EOSC329, EOSC429, EOSC372, EOSC373, EOSC471.

## Dashboards for courses

[Dashboards](dashboards.html) to engage students and instructors with interactive tools enabling exploration ofdata sets and concepts in climate or environmental sciences, geophysics, oceanography, etc. 

## Examples from outside this project

* [Allen Downey's "How to think like a computer scientist"](https://phaustin.github.io/think_jupyter/preface.html)
* [David Pine's Scientific Python tutorial](http://phaustin.github.io/pyman/)

## Student examples

* Evan William's Landsat directed studies project
* Chris Rodell's work on translating EOSC 410 materials to Jupyter book format.
