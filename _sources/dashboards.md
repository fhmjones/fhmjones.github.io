# Dashboard learning resources

## Building and deploying dashboards

**What are "dashboards"**? These are interactive mathematical or data exploration applications hosted online and used in any standard browser. They are used by instructors and students or other learners to explore complex data sets or experiment with challenging concepts.

This page will eventually provide guidelines and pointers to documentation for building and deploying dashboards for use in classes, student activities or assignments. But first some examples:

## Examples will be shown that explore...

* scientific natural concepts and processes
* data processing concepts
* complicated or extensive data sets
* mathematical or analysis techniques

## Dashboard development progress as of Nov. 8, 2020

The following dashboards are being developed for [ENVR 300, Introduction to Research in Environmental Science](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/academics/courses/envr300), to be tested during the winter term, 2021.
* **MonaLoaCO2 - goals**: Have students explore the capabilities and limitations of **linear models based on measurements** for explaining or predicting a time-varying physical phenomenon.
* **Three Signals - goals**: Demonstrate to students how various components can contribute to a complete timeseries signal. Currently, the procedure involves a sine wave, linear trend, random noise and smoothing of the result using a 5-pt moving average. Each can be enabled or disabled. Length of the sinewave can be adjusted from 1 to 10 cycles, and noise level can be adjusted.
* **Vancouver-Ozone - goals:**
  * Have students practice working with "messy" data sets using a year of ozone measurements from two sensors in SW British Columbia.
  * Compare ozone measurements at two locations, one near the ocean and one inland.
  * Compare raw, 7-day moving average and daily maximum 8-hr average. "Which makes what you want to learn most clearly visible?"
  * Explore impacts of plotting options on interpreability (eg. dots, lines, both, maybe others) (Not yet done.)

For [EOSC 340, Global Climate Change](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/academics/courses/eosc340), existing web-based climate modelling codes are being adapted for dashboard deployment, to be piloted during the winter term, 2021.

## Getting started

First section will include these requirements:

* Environment for develpment
* Python libraries, some required, others optional
* Buidling dashboard "apps" - code
* Building dashboard "apps" - design criteria for optimal learning
* Using apps - Voila and deployment to servers using containers.
